      category: "Web Browser", 
      reason: "Extensive data collection for ad targeting.", 
      alternative: "Brave Browser",
      detailedExplanation: "Google Chrome is designed to feed the world's largest advertising network. It tracks your history, extensions, and behavior. Brave is built on the same speed engine (Chromium) but automatically blocks trackers, ads, and fingerprinting scripts by default, keeping your data on your device."

      reason: "Exposes traffic to local interceptors.", 
      alternative: "VPN Service",
      detailedExplanation: "Public Wi-Fi networks in cafes or airports are often unencrypted. Hackers can sit on the same network and 'sniff' your packets to steal passwords or session cookies. A VPN creates an encrypted tunnel for your traffic, making it unreadable to anyone else on the network."

      alternative: "DuckDuckGo",
      detailedExplanation: "Standard search engines build a profile of you based on your queries to sell ads. DuckDuckGo does not store your personal information or search history. You get the same search results without the 'filter bubble' or invasive tracking cookies following you around the web."

      alternative: "Encrypted DNS",
      detailedExplanation: "Even with HTTPS, your Internet Service Provider (ISP) can see the domain names of websites you visit via DNS lookups. Switching to Encrypted DNS (like DNS-over-HTTPS) hides this lookup process, preventing your ISP from logging your browsing habits or selling that data."
